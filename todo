- make agent init signature default values as in json file

- make agent init signatures aligned

- prioritized dqn seems to work not that good, check it out

- "if done:" can be problematic since we use real_done for it (maybe store from main?)

- implement:
    [x] dqn
    [x] double dqn
    [x] dueling dqn
    [x] prioritized dqn
    [x] reinforce
    [x] a2c
    [x] ddpg
    [ ] maddpg/matd3
    [x] td3
    [ ] sac
    [ ] trpo
    [ ] ppo
    [ ] td3 her
    [ ] rnd
    [ ] apex
